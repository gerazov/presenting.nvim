== `presenting.nvim`

`presenting.nvim` is a neovim plugin that turns your markup files into
slides (in neovim).

It is rewrite of
https://github.com/sotte/presenting.vim/[`presenting.vim`] in lua. It
simplifies the code (and removes some features). `presenting.vim` is a
clone of https://github.com/pct/present.vim[`present.vim`] which is a
clone of https://github.com/sorah/presen.vim[`presen.vim`].

== Usage

With `presenting.nvim` installed and configured (see section below) open
a markdown/org/adoc file, then start the presentation using global
`Presenting` lua object:

....
:lua Presenting.toggle()
....

or using the `Presenting` user command:

....
:Presenting
....

Then navigate the presentation with the keys: - _q_: quit presentation
mode - _n_: next slide - _p_: previous slide - _f_: first slide - _l_:
last slide

=== Usage - I want to know more

This `README` is intentionally short. For more information, see
`:help presenting.nvim` and the
https://github.com/sotte/presenting.nvim/blob/main/doc/presenting.txt[documentation].

== Installation and Setup

With `lazy.nvim`:

[source,lua]
----
return {
  "sotte/presenting.nvim",
  opts = {
    -- fill in your options here
    -- see :help Presenting.config
  },
  cmd = { "Presenting" },
}
----

== Tips

😎 Directly start a presentation from the CLI:

[source,bash]
----
nvim -c Presenting README.md
nvim -c Presenting README.org
nvim -c Presenting README.adoc
----

🔬 Zoom in with your terminal emulator to make the slides *bigger*.

== DevMode

There is a dev mode that unloads+reloads the plugin which is handy if
you’re developing the plugin.

== Demo of markup elements

I use this README as a demo of the markup elements. The following
sections don’t have to do anything with the plugin itself.

=== Markup and Lists

*bolb* and _italic_ and _italic_ and `code` and [line-through]*strike*
and mark and underline

* list
* list
** list
** list

=== Code block

[source,python]
----
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
